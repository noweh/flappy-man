- **Responsive Controls**: Control Flappy-man with the keyboard and help him fly through the air while avoiding obstacles.

- **Randomized Obstacles**: Each game generates a new set of buildings with randomly placed gaps, ensuring a fresh experience every time.
- **Collision Detection**: Impacting buildings or the ground ends the game, with a fun twist where the character display reacts to collisions.
